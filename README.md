### Goal
Your challenge is to detect functional tissue units (FTUs) across different tissue preparation pipelines. 

An FTU is defined as a “three-dimensional block of cells centered around a capillary, such that each cell in this block is within diffusion distance from any other cell in the same block”. 

The goal of this competition is the implementation of a successful and robust glomeruli FTU detector.
